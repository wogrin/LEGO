## Low-carbon Expansion Generation Optimization (LEGO) model

We need to say that we had a preliminary version of Low-carbon Expansion Generation Optimization (LEGO), which has now been extended to account:
* Freely available and code (and data examples) shared on Github. And there are some novelties.
* Flexible and modular. 
* Unique combinations.
* Plus all the technical constraints (cycle aging costs for batteries), UC, etc.
* _Novelty_: expansion planning with inertia and AC-OPF and Demand Side Management (transmission expansion planning TEP in DC + AC, DSM, and generation expansion planning).

Temporal flexibility and modularity of the model is something quite unique (that enables a plethora of many different studies) with one single model.
